ProprioLoop is an interactive motion visualizer designed to train a mover's attention to consciously consider non-visual sensory input in the movement decision-making process. With visuals that amplify and highlight physically sensible differences in movement, such as sudden or sustained changes in momentum, the audience gains access to the more intimate, subjective experience of the mover.<br/>
